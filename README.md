# Linear-Regression-Project

In this final project for my Linear Algebra class of the Fall 2022 semester, I applied linear regression to a real data set 
and solved the least-squares problem for many data points. This allowed for me to model the data by plotting in a 3D graph 
that visually describes the line or curve of best fit for the data.
